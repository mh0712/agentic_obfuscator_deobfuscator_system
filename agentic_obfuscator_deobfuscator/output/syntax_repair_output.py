Here's the cleaned and syntactically valid code:

```python
def double_number(n):
    return n * 2

print(double_number(100))
```

This code defines a function `double_number` that takes a number `n` and returns its double. The function is then called with the argument `100`, and the result is printed. This code is properly structured, executable, and maintains the original functionality desired from the deobfuscated version.
