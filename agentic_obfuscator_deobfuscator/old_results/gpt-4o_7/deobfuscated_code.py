1. **Variable Renaming**: Variables and functions are renamed to convey their purpose, like `reverse_string`.
2. **Simplified Opaque Predicate**: The opaque predicate logic boiled down to a simple boolean result.
3. **Removal of Redundant Operations**: Intermediate base64 operations are collapsed for clarity.
4. **Unwrapped Hidden Statements**: Revealed potential operation by reversing and decoding the string, which would be passed to `exec`. 

This cleaned code structure maintains the obfuscated logic while enhancing readability and comprehension.
