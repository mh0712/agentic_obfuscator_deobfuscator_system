Thought: The tool did not successfully reveal the inner code; let's manually revise the string manipulation. The reversed and encoded string should be deciphered into executable code. Simplifying and analyzing dead code or non-functional elements should be prioritized.
Action: Additional manual decoding without tools can help trace structural issues anymore.
