        "1. Identify key variables, constants, or function names in the code that are critical to its logic.",
        "2. Create aliases for these identifiers by producing new names (e.g., `tempVar`, `hiddenFunc`) that still map to the original identifier.",
        "3. Replace all occurrences of the original identifier with its alias throughout the code.",
        "4. Use proxy imports by wrapping the import statements in functions and assigning the imports to obfuscated variables.",
        "5. Ensure that the alias is used consistently and that the original name is no longer directly visible in the code.",
        "6. Avoid making the aliases too predictable (e.g., using random or misleading names like `alpha`, `bravo`, etc.) to make it harder to trace the original variable or function names.",
        "7. If necessary, group multiple aliases for related identifiers (e.g., multiple variables or functions) under a common name or structure.",
        "8. Ensure the program behaves exactly as before, with no functional changes or side effects caused by the aliasing."
