    {
      "suggested_action": "Review and adjust the naming obfuscation technique in `evykemys` to ensure that format strings and named parameters are preserved correctly.",
      "reason": "The error 'KeyError: 'name'' indicates that the code is trying to access a dictionary or use a format string key that was altered during obfuscation. Properly handling format strings can prevent this KeyError."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Refine arithmetic obfuscation in `oxvjezwn` to maintain precision during calculations.",
      "reason": "The discrepancy observed in test results indicates a precision mismatch. The obfuscation might be altering the operations or data types leading to loss of precision. Adjustments should be made to ensure numerical accuracy."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Ensure logic is preserved during obfuscation of `eyqmdisk` to maintain semantic equivalence.",
      "reason": "The logic deviation suggests the transformation steps might have altered control flows or logical operations unintentionally, leading to different outputs. A more cautious approach to logic obfuscation is required to prevent such deviations."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Conduct a comprehensive review of the runtime error handling in the obfuscation process, focusing on correctly managing named variables and parameters.",
      "reason": "Detecting the runtime error 'KeyError' suggests the obfuscation process distorted the handling of specific identifiers. Ensuring variable name consistency during obfuscation will improve reliability."
