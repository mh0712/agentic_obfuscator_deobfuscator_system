      "reason": "The obfuscated code encountered a UnicodeDecodeError indicating that there's a mishandling in character encoding during the obfuscation process. This suggests that non-UTF-8 characters might be improperly introduced or mishandled, leading to runtime errors when interpreting the byte sequence. Adjust the encoding handling during obfuscation to ensure that the characters remain compatible with UTF-8 expectations, possibly by avoiding introduction of non-UTF-8 byte sequences or encoding results in purely ASCII or validated UTF-8 encoding."
