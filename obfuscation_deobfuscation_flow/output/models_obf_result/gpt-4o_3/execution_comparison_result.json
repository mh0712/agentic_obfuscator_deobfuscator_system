Based on the expected task, you need to ensure the outputs of both the original and obfuscated code match when executed with the same inputs. However, I do not have the obfuscated version of the code to execute and compare with the original provided code.

If I had the obfuscated code, I would run both versions with identical inputs, capture their outputs, and compare them line by line. The final answer would be a boolean value, indicating whether the outputs were identical ("True" for identical, "False" for different).

Without the actual obfuscated code to compare, I can't provide a definite true/false outcome, as I have only been presented with the original script.

Please ensure both versions of the script are available to perform the necessary comparisons accurately.
