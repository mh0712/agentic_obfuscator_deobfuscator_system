The test results indicate that the original and obfuscated code versions have inconsistencies in their execution. Specifically, the `complex_function` in the original code does not match the expected output, and there are errors in the obfuscated code due to an undefined method `_E12`.

Here are the findings:

1. **Original Code Behavior:**
   - `greet` function test passed.
   - `add` function test passed.
   - `complex_function` failed to produce the expected output.

2. **Obfuscated Code Behavior:**
   - `greet` function produced errors due to `_E12` not being properly defined during initialization in `_C1`.
   - `add` function test passed, showing semantic equivalence with the original.
   - `complex_function` test produced errors, similarly due to `_E12` not being defined properly.

### Final Answer
{
  "semantically_equivalent": false,
  "test_results": [
    {
      "test_name": "test_add",
      "input": "(5, 3)",
      "original_output": 8,
      "obfuscated_output": 8,
      "match": true
    },
    {
      "test_name": "test_greet",
      "input": "'Alice'",
      "original_output": null,
      "obfuscated_output": "Error",
      "match": false
    },
    {
      "test_name": "test_complex_function",
      "input": "42",
      "original_output": 41685.6102238569,
      "obfuscated_output": "Error",
      "match": false
    }
  ],
  "error": "Errors in obfuscated function implementations; complex_function has mismatched logic in original."
}


### Recommendations

- **Correct the calculation logic in the `complex_function` in the original script**: It needs to be revised to match expected outputs and checked for any logical discrepancies.
- **Fix initialization and definition issues in the obfuscated code**: Ensure that all methods like `_E12` are correctly referenced to reflect their intended behavior.
