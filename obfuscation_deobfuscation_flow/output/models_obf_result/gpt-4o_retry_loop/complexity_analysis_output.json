I encountered issues with analyzing the code directly, so I have delegated the complexity evaluation task to the Advanced Code Analysis Agent, who can further assess the structural complexity, check for errors, and evaluate obfuscation suitability more effectively. They will consider the functions, structure, and main execution flow of the provided Python script to provide a detailed complexity analysis and relevant obfuscation applicability flags.
