  "recommendations": [
    {
      "suggested_action": "Correct the calculation logic in the `complex_function` in the original script",
      "reason": "The `complex_function` failed to match the expected output in the original code, indicating that there is a logical flaw that must be corrected before applying obfuscation. Ensuring the original function works correctly is vital for accurate reproduction in the obfuscated version."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Fix initialization and definition issues in the obfuscated code",
      "reason": "The obfuscated code contained errors due to an undefined method `_E12`, which caused both the `greet` and `complex_function` to produce errors. It's crucial to ensure that all methods and variables are defined and initialized correctly to maintain functionality."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Review method obfuscation and renaming strategies",
      "reason": "The error with `_E12` suggests that the method renaming or obfuscation strategy was too aggressive or improperly configured, leading to unresolved references. Adjust the strategy to correctly handle method and variable renaming to prevent such errors."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Re-evaluate the `_C1` class initialization",
      "reason": "Given the initialization issue reported in the stack trace, examining how classes are restructured or renamed during obfuscation is essential to prevent inadvertent method exclusion or initialization errors."
