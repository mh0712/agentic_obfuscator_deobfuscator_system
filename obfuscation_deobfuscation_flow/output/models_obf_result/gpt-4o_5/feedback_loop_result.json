  "recommendations": [
    {
      "suggested_action": "Review and modify string manipulation techniques to ensure consistent data types.",
      "reason": "The runtime error indicates a TypeError due to the attempted concatenation of a string and bytes. This suggests an obfuscation strategy that inadvertently altered data types during transformation, leading to runtime issues."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Enhance type inference stage to prevent type mismatches.",
      "reason": "Type mismatches like str and bytes concatenation could be mitigated by improving the type inference mechanism, ensuring that type changes do not conflict or result in runtime errors."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Add a post-transform validation layer to detect data type inconsistencies.",
      "reason": "Introducing a validation step post-obfuscation but pre-execution can catch type discrepancies early, preventing runtime failures by ensuring all transformations maintain expected data types."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Isolate obfuscation operations on strings and bytes.",
      "reason": "Ensuring that string and bytes operations are distinct can help avoid unintentional data type conversions, preserving the integrity of both data types."
