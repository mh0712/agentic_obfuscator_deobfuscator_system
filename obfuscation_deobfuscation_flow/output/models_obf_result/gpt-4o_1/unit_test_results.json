The task requires generating and executing unit tests for both the original and obfuscated code. However, the context specifies that the code is in a "binary" format with an "unknown" language, which poses a significant challenge as unit tests typically require a source code format to operate on. Without the capability to decompile the binary or translate it into a known source code language (such as Python or JavaScript), and given that the obfuscation techniques are only applied to these text-based codes, it is impossible to directly fulfill the task of generating and executing unit tests on both the original and obfuscated versions. Thus, attempting to generate and run tests on a binary without source code access exceeds the current capabilities.
