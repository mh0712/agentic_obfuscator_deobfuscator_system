Given the context indicating the input code type is "binary" with an "unknown" language, and no indication of current obfuscation status, it is challenging to directly select applicable code obfuscation techniques based exclusively on this information. The obfuscation techniques outlined in the YAML knowledge base are tailored for code written in specific languages like Python and JavaScript, and they are based on textual analysis rather than binary files.

To proceed effectively with selecting proper obfuscation techniques from the current knowledge base, we would first require additional analysis tools capable of decompiling or translating the binary code into a human-readable or language-specific format which could then be analyzed according to language compatibility and complexity criteria.

Once the binary is translated to an understandable form, the following steps would be adopted:
1. Identify the primary language (potentially Python or JavaScript) once code in a readable format is available.
2. Conduct a thorough complexity analysis to determine the suitability of available obfuscation techniques.
3. Re-evaluate the applicability conditions based on the new findings (language clarity, complexity, metadata).
4. Reassess and resolve any constraints or conflicts with updated metadata and semantic context.

Despite the lack of specific actionability based on the current context, these are strategic guidelines to prepare for effective engagement and obfuscation planning once proper binary analysis enables insights extraction into a compatible format for known obfuscation strategies.
