The task cannot be completed as described due to the nature of the code being in binary format with an unknown language, making it impossible to directly compare the outputs of the original and obfuscated versions without additional processes such as decompilation or translation into a text-based language. The current tools are specifically designed for Python and JavaScript, hence without further conversion and analysis, no comparison can be made. Therefore, the boolean result of equivalence is indeterminate. 

However, here is how the JSON report should be structured if such a comparison were possible:

```json
{
  "equivalence": null,
  "details": {
    "reason": "Binary code in unknown language cannot be processed with the current tools designed for Python and JavaScript code."
  }
}
```

Recommendation: To proceed with verification, additional steps are recommended such as decompiling the binary into a text-based format that matches our tools' capabilities or using specialized binary analysis tools.
