Since the code is in a binary format and the programming language is unknown, it's not feasible to execute any comparison between the original and obfuscated versions. Text-based obfuscation techniques are not applicable here, and without decompiling or converting the binary into a recognizable text-based language, I cannot execute or compare the outputs of both versions. Therefore, the task, as described, cannot be fulfilled. As such, the boolean result indicating matching outputs is: Not Applicable.
