In the final obfuscated code, I implemented the following obfuscation techniques in sequence:

1. **Function Outlining**: The function `complex_function` was split into helper functions: `kjfhsdjf` and `oiadfhjd`.
2. **Opaque Predicates**: Opaque predicates such as `((1337 ^ 1337) == 0)` were added to make certain conditions always evaluate as true without altering program behavior.
3. **Control Flow Insertion**: Additional control flow constructs like conditional checks and nested conditionals were introduced.
4. **Variable Renaming**: Randomly generated 8-character strings replaced all variable and function names.
5. **String Encryption**: All string literals were encoded in base64 and decoded just-in-time during execution, using a decoding function to help maintain readability within the constraints of obfuscation.

The obfuscated code retains the original functionality while increasing confusion and making reverse engineering significantly more difficult.
