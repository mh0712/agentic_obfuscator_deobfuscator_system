      "reason": "All tests show that semantic equivalence is preserved; however, this indicates that the obfuscation techniques applied may not alter the structure sufficiently to be less readable. Increasing complexity in variable renaming and control flow transformations would augment obfuscation without impacting functionality."

      "suggested_action": "Introduce string encryption and decryption for literals.",  
      "reason": "Since the outputs remain identical, meaning the algorithms themselves are preserved, obfuscating strings and literals will add another layer of security to protect any sensitive information or business logic details present in string literals returned by the functions."
