  "recommendations": [
    {
      "suggested_action": "Investigate and resolve import restrictions by adjusting the environment or using dependency mockups.",
      "reason": "Import restrictions led to execution issues, preventing a complete assessment of code behavior. Modifying the environment or using mocks will allow for proper testing and comparison."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Review and adjust transformation sequences to retain compatibility with Python syntax rules.",
      "reason": "The message 'No result variable found' indicates a misalignment in variable handling post-transformation, suggesting a need to preserve essential syntax structures like variable definitions."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Implement staged obfuscation with frequent interim testing to catch early-stage failures.",
      "reason": "Incremental obfuscation, with validations at each step, will provide clarity on where breakdowns occur, allowing for targeted adjustments rather than a monolithic transformation."
    },
    {
      "suggested_action": "Engage the specialized coworker early in the obfuscation cycle for potential environment setup assistance.",
      "reason": "Their expertise in handling execution constraints can preemptively address issues, ensuring smooth tool operation and setup conformity."
